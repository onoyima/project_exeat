# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on enhancing the student dashboard to better align with our design philosophy of minimalist design, progressive disclosure, visual hierarchy, and consistency. The enhancement will improve the user experience by reorganizing information architecture, implementing better visual hierarchy, and creating more intuitive navigation patterns while working with existing data structures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want a cleaner and more organized dashboard layout, so that I can quickly understand my exeat status and find important information without visual clutter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display information using progressive disclosure principles
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL use consistent spacing following the design philosophy (space-y-4, space-y-6, space-y-8)
3. WHEN displaying cards THEN the system SHALL implement proper visual hierarchy with clear typography levels
4. WHEN showing statistics THEN the system SHALL group related information logically with appropriate visual separation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want better visual indicators for my exeat request statuses, so that I can immediately understand the current state of my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing exeat requests THEN the system SHALL use semantic colors consistently across all status indicators
2. WHEN displaying status badges THEN the system SHALL follow the design philosophy color standards (bg-green-100 text-green-800 for success, etc.)
3. WHEN showing request cards THEN the system SHALL implement clear visual hierarchy with proper icon usage (w-4 h-4, w-5 h-5, w-6 h-6)
4. WHEN displaying active vs completed requests THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual distinction

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want improved information architecture on my dashboard, so that I can focus on the most important information first and access details when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL prioritize active/pending requests over historical data
2. WHEN displaying statistics THEN the system SHALL show the most actionable metrics prominently
3. WHEN presenting student information THEN the system SHALL use progressive disclosure to show essential details first
4. WHEN showing recent requests THEN the system SHALL limit initial display and provide expansion options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want better responsive design and touch-friendly interactions, so that I can effectively use the dashboard on mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing on mobile THEN the system SHALL implement mobile-first responsive design (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3)
2. WHEN interacting with buttons THEN the system SHALL ensure minimum 44px touch targets
3. WHEN viewing cards THEN the system SHALL use responsive spacing (p-4 md:p-6)
4. WHEN displaying the layout THEN the system SHALL maintain usability across all screen sizes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student, I want improved loading states and micro-interactions, so that the interface feels responsive and provides clear feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is loading THEN the system SHALL display skeleton components that match the final layout
2. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide subtle feedback (hover:bg-gray-50)
3. WHEN transitioning between states THEN the system SHALL use consistent animation timing (transition-all duration-200)
4. WHEN focusing on elements THEN the system SHALL provide clear focus indicators (focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a student, I want better accessibility and keyboard navigation, so that I can use the dashboard effectively regardless of my interaction method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL provide logical tab order and focus management
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
3. WHEN viewing content THEN the system SHALL maintain color contrast ratios of at least 4.5:1
